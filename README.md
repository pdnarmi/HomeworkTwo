# HomeworkTwo

This is the readme file for my second homework project!

For this assignment, we were required to design and create
a portfolio website utilizing grid, bootsrap, and flexbox
to come up with the layout for the pages.

Though the final product is far from a polished piece of 
work, I believe I have met the assignment requirements. I
plan in the future to retun to this assignment to add
javascript elements to the page and to update/improve the
overall design.
